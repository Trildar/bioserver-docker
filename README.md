# Open Source Outbreak Server

Hi all

To briefly state the goal behind this project, it's simply to preserve [dev ghostline](https://gitlab.com/users/gh0stl1ne/projects)'s Bioserver1 & 2 projects, as neither of these are available on github and both require a bit of work to get up and running.

The initial commit is identical to both projects, but in a single repo instead of separate repos.

`Biohazard Outbreak private server.pdf` offers some guidance, but this will need to be rewritten and replaced.
UPD: Setup your dnmasq
`cp bioserv1/.config.properties.example bioserv1/bioserv/config.properties`
And set server ip
`cp bioserv1/.config.properties.example bioserv1/bioserv/config.properties`
